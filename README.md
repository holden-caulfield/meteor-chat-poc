# meteor-chat-poc

This is a simple POC exercise on creating a basic chat with meteor which would run on web, iOS and Android. I did this to check how fast I could get something working on the three platforms.

Discailmer: this is quite quick-and-dirty exercise, some elements like the zero division between client and server data, lack of an actual router and the awful CSS are not meant to be an example to anybody.
