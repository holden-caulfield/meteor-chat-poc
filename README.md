# meteor-chat-poc

This is a simple POC exercise on creating a basic chat with meteor which would run on web, iOS and Android. I did this to check how fast I could get something working on the three platforms.

Discailmer: this is quite quick-and-dirty exercise, the architecture (or lack of it) does not attempt by any means to suggest how you should structure a meteor project. Definitively the fact that everything is on single files, the zero division between client and server data and the awful CSS are not meant to be an example to anybody
